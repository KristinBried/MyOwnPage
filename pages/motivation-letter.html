<p class="motivation-para">
Hello! My name is Kristine Briede, I’m 27 years old and I would like to candidate to Junior developer internship 
position in company Cognizant Technology Solutions.
</p>

<p class="motivation-para">
At beginning of this year was the end of my parental leave and I took 
decision to change my professional career to totally different one – I 
has been worked as different level marketing specialist previously but 
decided to start to learn coding. My first step in my career changing was 
to complete coding courses (which I did – I finished Riga Coding School WEB 
development courses). In courses I developed and improved very good HTML, CSS skills. 
Also I learned basics of Java Script and little bit of PHP (but still working on 
PHP skill improvement as these skills I would rate as pretty low).  
Here I would like to point out that I’m not student and not studying anymore – I’m someone who has completed courses and is willed 
to keep growing the skills.
</p>

<p class="motivation-para">
For my own training and a way how to present my coding skills to my potential employer 
I developed my own personal page which provides my virtual CV function – you can find it 
here - <a href="https://kristinbried.github.io/MyOwnPage/">My personal WEB page</a>. In page you can find my portfolio and 
link to my GitHub page as well.
</p>

<p class="motivation-para">
Despite the fact that it’s not easy at this moment to find internship, I’m very 
interested to find one. I see it as the only way how to strengthen and improve my 
skills and that’s the only bridge that could connect in courses gained knowledge and 
first real job in IT field as well.
</p>

<p class="motivation-para">
Before maternity leave I worked in multiple companies and described my career as 
“Still looking for my right place”, but for now I have changed my mind and values – 
I want to start new and permanent career in one company and keep grow inside it. 
Therefore in case of positive cooperation I would be interested to keep working in Cognizant 
after internship and could do that for full time.
</p>

<p class="motivation-para">
If I have to describe my personality in three characteristics, I would describe myself as very 
hardworking, accurate and purposeful person. If we are talking about coding – 
I would say that I’m very attracted to it and find it very interesting and challenging.
</p>

<p class="motivation-para">
I rate my English skills as good – I had to use a lot of English in my previous works. 
Despite the fact that I didn’t had to use it daily in last two years, 
I’m sure that language won’t be problem for me.
</p>

<p class="motivation-para">
In case if you will choose me for internship position I am ready to accept 3 month long working period.
</p>
